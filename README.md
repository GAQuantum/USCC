# USCC
Unitary selective coupled cluster method for quantum chemistry on quantum computers
The method is decribed in the article at https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12652

The main script to run a simulation is USCC.py, which saves all results into an hdf5 file.
The plot_all.ipynb botebook can be used for plotting to reproduce the Figure 2 from the article, 
it uses the hdf5 files generated by the main script.

It was only tested python environment specified in environment.yml which can be easily reproduced using anaconda. 
The incompatibility issues can happen most likely due to the constantly changing structure of Qiskit.
